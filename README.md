# MyAstroReport

MyAstroReport utilizes third party HTTP requests with ASP.NET, and a custom InMemory database with Entity Framework. The backend allows for user login and sign up.  It handles a custom API and two third party API requests. Using React on the front end, the user is able to create an account and sign in (with basic authentication), create reports, and save reports with HTTP requests.
